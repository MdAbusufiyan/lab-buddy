# LAB Buddy

LAB Buddy is a lightweight desktop application designed for chemical lookup and logging in laboratory environments.

The application retrieves chemical information from PubChem (NIH) and supports offline usage through a local cache, making it suitable for laboratories with limited or unreliable internet access.

## Features
- Online chemical search via PubChem
- Offline access using local cache
- Display of chemical identifiers and properties
- Structure image display
- GHS hazard pictograms and hazard statements (limited)
- Excel (.xlsx) logging

## Download

A precompiled Windows executable is available from the GitHub Releases page.

- Download the latest `LAB_Buddy_v1.0.exe`
- No Python installation is required

## Usage

1. Download the Windows executable from GitHub Releases
2. Run the executable
3. Enter a chemical name, CAS number, or identifier in the search box
4. When online, data is fetched from PubChem
5. When offline, previously cached data is used
6. Use the “Save” button to log results into an Excel file

The application is designed to run on low-specification laboratory computers.
